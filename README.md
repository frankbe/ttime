# ttime - Time tracking with simple text files

You record our work time with your favourite editor in a simple text file (see example_times.txt).
The tool is only used to analyse the time data.

## setup

* clone the repository
* `cd ttime`
* `python setup.py install --user`

## run the samples

* `ttime [PATH_TO_REPOSITORY_CLONE]/example_times.txt`

## use it

* create a time tracking text file with the same format as example_times.txt
* run `ttime.py FILE_NAME` to see a working summary
